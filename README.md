# drone-detect

Hello! This is my project on detecting drone noise on audio snippets. 
This project was based on the [Conference Paper Here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332727775_Audio_Based_Drone_Detection_and_Identification_using_Deep_Learning) and Y. Zhang et al. (2017)[^1]
Detecting Drone noise (Mambo and Bebop) from audio files using Machine Learning
